#  Hierarchy

- The Hierarchy section in Unity is where all the Game objects(cameras, sprites, managers(UI, Audio, etc.), lights) used in the scene are visible.
- Hierarchy makes it easy for sorting game objects or club them together in a parent object. It is also easy for removing and add game objects from Hierarchy rather than the Scene view.
- You can press Ctrl + 4 to open the Hierarchy window.
